# CHESS GAME

### Group Members:
1. Arbaz Narejo (22K-4031)
2. S Huzaifa Ali (23K-0004)
3. Haris Ahmed (23K-6005)

### Video Demo:



### Contributions:

- S Huzaifa Ali
  1. Initialization of the board
  2. Move logic for all the pieces

- Haris Ahmed
  1. Capture conditions for all the pieces
  2. Special moves including (castling, enpassant capture, pawn promotion)

- Arbaz Narejo
  1. Check condition
  2. Countering the check using different techniques (blocking using other pieces, moving the king to safety, capturing the piece)


### Problems Faced:
1. Describing move logic for every piece
2. Implementing capturing conditions for all pieces
3. Handling check condition
4. Implementation of all the functions in the main function


### Solutions:
1. Creating variables to keep track of row and column differences and using them efficiently in move logic
2. When move logic was implemented efficiently the capturing conditions were done easily
3. Handling check condition was clearly a difficult part in the entire game. To manage this we created different functions which analyzed whether king is in check, implemented 3 different functions containing the logic for separate ways to avoid being checked.
4. Implementation in main function was by far the hardest and most challenging part in the entire code. To solve this we spent alot of time on the code.
